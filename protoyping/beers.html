        <h2>Our Craft Beers</h2>
        <p>Each beer is handmade and personally tasted. Just part of them "made with love" process at Hops House.</p>

      <h3>Growlers <div class="price">$7</div></h3>
      <p>Keep your beer cold and once the cap is removed, it's best to enjoy the beer within the next several hours. Rinse-out the growler as soon as practical. When you have time, soak in hot soapy water for a few minutes and use a brush to wash or shake vigorously. Drain and rinse out a couple of times. Turn the growler upside down to drain. Dry and store with the cap off. If your growler does not pass the quality control check (nose-check) when you bring it in, we'll wash it on the spot to ensure the quality of your beer.</p>
