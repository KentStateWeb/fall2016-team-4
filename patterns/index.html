      <p>Hopps House  was founded with a simple purpose: create a welcoming social atmosphere where friends can gather and
        learn about high-quality beer. Like many great discoveries, it was founded in neighborhood Kent garages, where
        homebrew flowed and hops grew up backyard trellises. When creativity, aspirations, and equipment got a
        little too large for our tiny garages the inevitable craft brewery was born. We continue to be grounded in family,
        friends, beer education, and the quest for the ever perfect pint. </p>
